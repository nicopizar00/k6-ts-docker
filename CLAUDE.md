# k6-ts-docker

A small, maintainable proof-of-concept for running k6 performance tests written
in TypeScript, packaged in Docker, and executed via GitHub Actions.

## Purpose

Demonstrate a clean, end-to-end pipeline for performance testing that is easy
for both humans and AI coding assistants to read, extend, and reason about.

## Execution chain

The project follows a single, linear pipeline. Every change should preserve it:

    TypeScript source  →  bundle (single JS file)  →  Docker image  →
    k6 execution       →  reports (JSON / summary)

If a proposed change does not fit this chain, stop and discuss before adding it.

## Tech stack

- **k6** — load testing runtime (executes the bundled JS).
- **TypeScript** — author tests with types and editor support.
- **Bundler** — produces a single ES module consumable by k6 (k6 does not run
  Node modules directly). Tool choice TBD; prefer the smallest config that works.
- **Docker** — reproducible execution environment based on the official
  `grafana/k6` image.
- **GitHub Actions** — runs the Docker image on push / PR / manual dispatch and
  uploads reports as artifacts.

## Rules

1. **Docker First.** Docker is the primary interface for building, running, and
   validating the project. The host requires only Docker — no Node, no k6, no
   other runtimes. `npm`/bundler invocations happen inside the Docker build
   stage and are implementation details, not user-facing commands.
2. **Small, reviewable steps.** Each change should be understandable in one
   sitting. Prefer multiple small PRs over one large one.
3. **No unnecessary dependencies.** Every dependency must earn its place. If
   the standard library or a few lines of code suffice, use those.
4. **No premature abstraction.** Three similar lines are better than a clever
   helper. Wait for the third real use case before extracting.
5. **Preserve the execution chain.** Source → bundle → image → run → report.
   Don't shortcut or branch it.
6. **AI-friendly.** File names, directory layout, and scripts should be
   self-describing. Avoid hidden conventions.
7. **Don't implement ahead of the plan.** Follow the agreed step list; flag
   anything that requires going beyond it.

## Common commands

- `./bin/build` — build images (bundles TypeScript internally).
- `./bin/test-smoke` — build if needed, start the API, run the smoke test; results appear in `reports/`.
- `./bin/clean` — tear down containers and remove locally-built images.

## For AI assistants

- Read this file first.
- Before adding files, dependencies, or abstractions, confirm they fit the
  execution chain and the structure above.
- Propose changes in small, reviewable steps. Do not implement a full feature
  in one pass unless explicitly asked.
- When in doubt, ask.
